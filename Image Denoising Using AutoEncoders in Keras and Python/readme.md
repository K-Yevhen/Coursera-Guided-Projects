### Learning Objectives:

--- Understand the theory and intuition behind Autoencoders.

--- Import Key libraries, dataset and visualize images.

--- Perform image normalization and add random noise to images.

--- Build an autoencoder using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a backend.

--- Compile and fit autoencoder model to training data.

--- Assess the performance of trained autoencoder.
